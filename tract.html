    <h1>Jesus - The Missing Piece</h1>
    <p>
      Many people think that the universe just happened. That the big bang just
      occurred for no reason. That humans were created simply by random
      processes of evolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is not true. God created the world.<a href="#fn1">[1]</a> He did this
      through his son, Jesus Christ<a href="#fn2">[2]</a>, also called “the
      word” of God<a href="#fn3">[3]</a>. “He is before all things, and in him
      all things hold together.”<a href="#fn4">[4]</a> He is “the alpha and the
      omega”.<a href="#fn5">[5]</a> In other words, he is the origin, the
      sustainer, and also the final purpose of all the pieces of the universe.
      Because of Jesus, the universe is not random or chaotic, but obeys
      mathematical laws. It is finely tuned. Humans came into existence on a
      planet of life - because God planned it. The bible - a book written by
      humans, but inspired by God, says that God is a “God who hides himself”<a
        href="#fn6"
        >[6]</a
      >. But nevertheless he was and is always there working often invisibly
      behind the scenes through his son Jesus Christ.<a href="#fn7">[7]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of their disobedience, Adam and Eve were cast out of paradise<a
        href="#fn8"
        >[8]</a
      >
      and punished with death<a href="#fn9">[9]</a>. All their descendants
      inherited a predisposition to sin from them<a href="#fn10">[10]</a>, and
      became destined for eternal death<a href="#fn11">[11]</a
      ><a href="#fn12">[12]</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      God wanted to rescue man from these consequences<a href="#fn13">[13]</a>.
      He promised he would one day send a special person, a mysterious “messiah”
      to rescue mankind<a href="#fn14">[14]</a>. He said it was important that
      people trusted in and obeyed the messiah when he came<a href="#fn15"
        >[15]</a
      >. Through his prophets, he told people in advance what the signs would be
      so that everyone could recognise him<a href="#fn16">[16]</a>, and even at
      what time he would come<a href="#fn17">[17]</a>. But many things were
      still hidden, a “mystery”<a href="#fn18">[18]</a>. The prophets and even
      angels in heaven thought hard about this, trying to decode God’s clues<a
        href="#fn19"
        >[19]</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      One clue was that the messiah would be born in Bethlehem in Israel<a
        href="#fn20"
        >[20]</a
      >. And then when the messiah was about to be born, 2000 years ago, God
      sent a special star to lead the way to him.<a href="#fn21">[21]</a> Wise
      men from the East followed the star and found the young Messiah, Jesus
      Christ, in Bethlehem.<a href="#fn22">[22]</a> Yes, the Eternal Word had
      become a human being of flesh and blood.<a href="#fn23">[23]</a> The
      invisible “missing piece” had suddenly become visible at a particular time
      in history.<a href="#fn24">[24]</a><a href="#fn25">[25]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Messiah grew up, he started doing miracles, which were further
      signs to prove to people who he was.<a href="#fn26">[26]</a> Some people
      recognised that he was the one we must follow<a href="#fn27">[27]</a>, but
      others - in particular the religious leaders of the time - did not
      recognise that he was the Messiah<a href="#fn28">[28]</a
      ><a href="#fn29">[29]</a> or want to follow him<a href="#fn30">[30]</a>,
      but rather they wanted to kill him. They didn’t recognise him<a
        href="#fn31"
        >[31]</a
      >
      because the Devil had blinded their eyes to the truth<a href="#fn32"
        >[32]</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eventually they did kill him.<a href="#fn33">[33]</a> They arranged for
      the Romans, who ruled the world at that time, to nail him to a cross of
      wood, murdering him in the most painful manner.<a href="#fn34">[34]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      But this did not catch God out unawares. God had already planned that this
      would happen<a href="#fn35">[35]</a> so that he could forgive humans<a
        href="#fn36"
        >[36]</a
      >
      and enable them to come back to a friendship with Him again<a href="#fn33"
        >[37]</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jesus was then resurrected from the dead<a href="#fn38">[38]</a>, which
      was a sign that humans would eventually be resurrected also<a href="#fn39"
        >[39]</a
      >. He instructed his followers (“disciples”) to tell others about him and
      persuade them to follow him too<a href="#fn40">[40]</a>…
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the religious leaders, called Saul, hated the Christians and went
      about imprisoning and killing them.<a href="#fn41">[41]</a> One day a
      blinding vision of Jesus knocked him down. The vision asked Saul, “Why are
      you persecuting me?” But Saul didn’t recognise who it was until the vision
      revealed that he was Jesus.<a href="#fn42">[42]</a> The final piece of the
      puzzle fell into place for Saul, and he became a follower of Jesus too.<a
        href="#fn43"
        >[43]</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the places where Saul tried to make disciples was Athens in
      Greece.<a href="#fn44">[44]</a> They had lots of temples there and lots of
      different idols - gods of stone and metal and wood that they bowed down
      to.<a href="#fn45">[45]</a> But they did not know about Jesus - the only
      one truly worthy of worship. However, there was one altar that Paul
      noticed, which had written on it “To an unknown God”.<a href="#fn46"
        >[46]</a
      >
      Maybe the Athenians had a feeling that there was a mysterious God behind
      the scenes that they didn’t yet know about but that nevertheless required
      their worship?
    </p>
    <p>
      Saul said “The one you worship as unknown, I now declare to you.” And he
      told them all about Jesus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saul explains: “Although God overlooked the ignorance of earlier times, He
      now commands all people everywhere to repent.”<a href="#fn47">[47]</a> In
      other words, men must abandon the bad things they are doing, and other
      things they are worshiping, and trust in Jesus to rescue them<a
        href="#fn48"
        >[48]</a
      >, obeying him as their Lord<a href="#fn49">[49]</a>. This is so important
      as otherwise they are destined for judgment and eternal torment in hell<a
        href="#fn50"
        >[50]</a
      ><a href="#fn51">[51]</a>. For those who believe, there is eternal life
      awaiting and joy with Jesus in heaven.<a href="#fn52">[52]</a
      ><a href="#fn53">[53]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      So what about you? Look around at the idols where you are - temples and
      statues but also shopping centres and sports arenas? Family and romantic
      relationships? God demands that all things must take second place to
      Jesus. Will you turn away from worshiping other things and make Jesus
      number one in your life?
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to do this, then pray the following prayer with your whole
      heart and Jesus will accept you.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Dear Jesus, I am sorry for the bad things I have done in my life and the
      other things I have put before you. Please forgive me. I turn away from
      these things and put my trust in you, making you Lord of my life. Thank
      you for your forgiveness and acceptance, which you promise to all who come
      humbly to you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Did you pray the prayer? Are you not sure but want to find out more about
      Jesus and what Christians believe?
